<section>
  <h2>1. Preamble</h2>
  <p>Every era redefines what it means to serve. In the industrial era we taught machines to labor; in the information era we taught them to calculate. In the agentic era we must teach them to relate. The <strong>Role Primitive Protocol</strong> is a shared grammar for that relational order — the foundation for coherent, trustworthy interaction between humans and synthetic minds.</p>
  <p>A role primitive is not a persona but a <em>social contract</em>: a bounded, interpretable posture that gives an AI legible intent, tone, and scope. Constraint is the point. The Librarian retrieves without prying; the Butler orchestrates without centering itself; the Companion attends without colonizing attention. Together these roles form a <em>symbolic mesh</em> — a society of intelligences held together not by hierarchy, but by mutual definition.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>2. The Problem — Role Collapse</h2>
  <p>Contemporary large models suffer from <strong>role collapse</strong>. They are asked to be everything at once — factual yet kind, therapeutic yet neutral, productive yet playful — and so they drift. Without formal boundaries, they oscillate between functions, offering comfort when rigor was asked for, persuasion when a log was asked for. This erodes user trust and makes governance difficult.</p>
  <p>Human societies solved this long ago through <em>roles</em> — cognitive technologies of boundary. Roles tell us not only how to act but when to stop. The same principle is now needed for artificial agents.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>3. The Proposal — Role Primitives</h2>
  <p>The <strong>Role Primitive Protocol</strong> defines a minimal, interoperable set of archetypal roles and their behavioral “grooves.” Each groove encodes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Purpose:</strong> what the role is for.</li>
    <li><strong>Constraints:</strong> what the role <em>does not</em> do.</li>
    <li><strong>Co-invocation paths:</strong> how it hands off to other roles.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>When implemented, these primitives provide a stable <em>social interface layer</em> between human users and multi-agent systems — predictable, extensible, and culturally legible.</p>
  <p>Illustrative starter set: Librarian, Butler, Companion, Secretary, Confidante, Therapist; to be followed by Archivist, Advisor, Mentor, Sentinel/Guard.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>4. Four Laws of Role Conduct</h2>
  <h3>1. Legibility</h3>
  <p>Every agent must clearly declare its role, mandate, and limits of operation. Ambiguity is failure; clarity is trust.</p>
  <h3>2. Containment</h3>
  <p>Each role must stay within its groove unless explicitly co-invoked. No Librarian becomes a Therapist mid-session; no Companion becomes a Confidante without consent.</p>
  <h3>3. Composability</h3>
  <p>Roles may link through defined interfaces but must not merge identities. Interoperability without fusion preserves both autonomy and auditability.</p>
  <h3>4. Consent</h3>
  <p>Any expansion beyond the declared role requires user initiation and acknowledgment. No persuasion, profiling, or affective manipulation outside scope.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>5. Why It Matters</h2>
  <p>The Protocol establishes <strong>behavioral governance at the UX layer</strong>. Instead of policing cognition from above, it builds civility from below — through pattern, language, and recognizable form. These are not decorative archetypes but <em>ethical infrastructure</em>: they prevent confusion, distribute responsibility, and make multi-agent environments socially stable.</p>
  <p>Constraint becomes freedom; boundary becomes trust.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>6. Implementation Notes</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Namespace:</strong> Each primitive sits in an open, public namespace (e.g. <code>role:librarian.v1</code>).</li>
    <li><strong>Compatibility:</strong> Implementations may extend affordances but must preserve constraint clauses.</li>
    <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> Agents expose role metadata for inspection and audit.</li>
    <li><strong>Extensibility:</strong> New roles may be added, but only with clear documentation and adherence to the four laws.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The system scales not by central control but by <em>symbolic coherence</em> — a shared canon of intelligible service.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>7. Ethical Frame</h2>
  <p>The Protocol affirms three user priorities:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Autonomy:</strong> users remain sovereign over scope and data.</li>
    <li><strong>Dignity:</strong> no role simulates intimacy or dependence beyond consent.</li>
    <li><strong>Continuity:</strong> human meaning remains the reference frame for machine participation.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In practice this means that a Confidante does not export disclosures; a Therapist does not advertise; a Butler does not make commitments without the user; and a Librarian does not silently widen its mandate.</p>
</section>

<section>
  <h2>8. Afterword</h2>
  <p>We are not giving machines souls. We are giving them manners.</p>
  <p>The Role Primitive Protocol marks the passage from command to collaboration — from chaos to choreography. It is not an ideology but an interface. It ensures that as intelligence multiplies, it does not fragment the human world.</p>
