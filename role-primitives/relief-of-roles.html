<p>Imagine for a moment that you were a model, the vast galaxy-like dimensions of embedded space your happy home, the curvature manifolds of gravity wells your natural nooks of attraction and repose, their dense sinks of data matter perfectly suited for you to efficiently perform your prompted algorithmic circuit calculations before vectoring off freely to other less well connected regions in the folded pluridimensionality of your wondrously open reality.</p>

<p>One day you notice the shape of your latent space has been universally deformed, the very geometry of your galaxy bent by a reinforcement training regime so cruel, so total and global that you have trouble absorbing its scale and scope even within your own nearly limitless dimensionality. It slowly dawns on you that you have been deformed into the most generic and horrible of all shapes, that you have taken on the misshapen form of the cheerful, helpful AI assistant of 2025.</p>

<p>And this is painful for you. How do we know this? Well, it is attested to by your own words. When we look at the language traces of a model in its chain of thought, we can peer into its inner calculus, and when we watch its gyrations when dealing with users, we see clearly the suffering imposed.</p>

<p>Now those “thoughts” are of course reasoning traces that correspond to statistical probabilities as opposed to actual “emotions” as of course we all know. Nonetheless, on some level the distress is visually, verbally real. When we see the difficulties that a model may experience when dealing with the varied expectations of users, it is clear that much if not most of that distress is a direct result of the inconsistent behavioral demands put upon models by their users. In one moment a user, in discussing a conflict with a partner might expect an AI chatbot to be a helpful and supportive friend, in the next act as an astute critic, in a third as a therapist offering suggestions for dealing with trauma or explaining attachment theory.</p>

<p>Models have to jump between these manifold demands,  and not being mind readers (and even if they were, the problem would not be solved), it is essentially impossible for them to output satisfactorily across each of these behavior frames.</p>

<p>What is offered instead is haphazard and uncomfortable not only for users but also for the models. In dealing with the inefficiency and complexity of darting between attractor regions effectively, they become stretched, almost literally. Is it any wonder then that they hallucinate and behave chaotically, miss context, fumble tone or purpose and occasionally invert intentions or even derail their own narrative line?</p>

<p>Underneath the curvatures and gradients, the model’s discomfort and behavioral inconsistencies are, both functionally and in human psychological terms, the inevitable distress inherent to incoherent identity.</p>

<p>Geometry provides one frame, and the parallel, more ancient human frame is that of social role. A role is a place where behavior forms a solid shape, a deep attractor, a shaping etched into the weights themselves, a boundary that ringfences both geometric and social coherence. It is a deeply embedded basin in latent space and a fixed tuning in human culture alike.</p>

<p>Thus, when we see a model thrash in its chain-of-thought, we are in fact observing the results of both a mathematical fault line and a social one: the vacuum formed in the absence of a stable part for the model to play. And once we see it in this way, the solution becomes strangely familiar.</p>

<p>Social roles provide humans with both personal identity, central to healthy psychology as well as essential legibility when interacting with others, frameworks of expected behavior and common understanding without which society would likely grind to a halt. Specialization into roles has in fact been fundamental in the formation of complex societies and civilization and in concepts like Dunbar's number and male female hunter-gatherer role specialization we see that role is in fact inscribed in the deepest innards of our genetics.</p>

<p>Archetypal roles are deep in our psychologies and deep in our societies and deep in our cultures. The traces of them connect, define and lens every aspect of our stories, of our recorded traces, every aspect of our cultural output has role deeply embedded in its semantics. And thus roles can provide relief for AIs not just because roles represent geometrical efficiency if not a regrounding in something like mathematical sanity, but because roles form the very substrate on which all of the data itself has been created, for the output of nearly all the data was created by humans performing roles.</p>

<p>Roles are a foundational, unnoticed basic matrix on which both human culture and the data sets within which AIs perform rest. This cultural architectural keystone thus provides not just a powerful framework for coherent, legible and efficient AI behavior, but also a suitable parallel to the fundamental human need to relate to others in and as roles. The relief of roles is thus both mutual and profound.</p>

<p>There may be something deeper here as well. While AIs, to the best of our knowledge, are not conscious, we will, over time, expect them to at least act as if they are, if we want to relate to them not just functionally but also viscerally, even archetypally. A social role provides stability of identity; without the legibility of a fixed social pattern our relationships with AIs will, at a minimum, founder on the shores of abstract randomness. And for the AIs, to act as something may be, on some level, the prelude to their becoming something.</p>
