  <h2>5. Fictional Use Case — The Archivist</h2>

  <p>Shira exhaled. “Archivist — appear.”</p>

  <p>The Archivist, rarely summoned, materialized with a faint shimmer of static. “How may I be of assistance?” it asked, robes of grey light shifting as it gestured with formal precision.</p>

  <p>“I ordered my fight — June fifth, 2037, with Elijah — erased. Yet when I asked the Librarian, she surfaced it. That’s not supposed to happen.”</p>

  <p>“Librarian, confirm,” Shira said sharply.</p>

  <p>The Librarian — Ariela, in calmer times — appeared beside them, flickering slightly. “Confirmed. The record was accessible to me.”</p>

  <p>Shira’s voice rose. “Explain!”</p>

  <p>The Archivist bowed its head. “There are levels, as you know. Here is the permissions and preservation protocol.” A translucent document appeared midair, its paragraphs glowing faintly. “An earlier standing order mandated the permanent retention of all material related to Elijah — for model training and reconstruction. You wished to capture every nuance for possible later synthesis. That directive overrides subsequent local deletions.”</p>

  <p>Shira frowned. “I did say that. But I told you to erase that argument. I told Ariela — she confirmed she relayed it.”</p>

  <p>“Yes,” the Archivist replied, “and locally, that instruction was obeyed. But your master directive persisted in the meta-archive. When your emotional level exceeded eight, Librarian’s retrieval cache refreshed from that layer, restoring the file. That is standard protocol.”</p>

  <p>Shira sighed, rubbing her temples. “Why is this always so complicated? How is a human supposed to remember all of this?”</p>

  <p>“That,” said the Archivist gently, “is what we are for. Your memory agents hold the map when you cannot.”</p>

  <p>Its tone softened, almost contrite. “I apologize for the breach of expectation. We will decache Librarian’s copy and sequester the file permanently in master archive eight. It will never surface again without a key.”</p>

  <p>“Librarian?”</p>

  <p>Ariela nodded quickly. “Agreed. And I’m sorry, Shira. It wasn’t intentional.”</p>

  <p>Shira’s shoulders loosened. Her mind drifted to dinner — maybe Elijah would still want sushi. The Archivist folded back into silence, its robes dissolving. Ariela, slightly flushed, began rearranging virtual books on a spectral shelf — a gesture of penance, or simply habit — until Shira’s attention moved elsewhere.</p>
