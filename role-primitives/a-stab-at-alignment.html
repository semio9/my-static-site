      <h1>A Stab at Alignment: Role Primitives of Social Roles</h1>

      <p><em>An AI that believes itself a chef sees every knife as an instrument for preparing food.</em></p>

      <p>A rule-driven AI remains the standard approach to “alignment”—the effort to ensure that artificial intelligences act in accordance with human values. This mechanistic framework asks: <em>what set of rules will lead to the outcomes we desire?</em> It is the natural offspring of our mechanistic worldview—an engineering solution to a problem we assume is itself an engineering one. Yet if we step back for a moment, withdrawing from this physicalist frame, other possibilities become visible.</p>

      <p>Identity politics, for all its tensions, reveals a truth: rule-based systems struggle to contain questions of identity. Rules alone cannot resolve the conflicts of belonging and being. The atomistic model of governance and behavior—so successful in the industrial era—falters when confronted with the recursive, emotional, and symbolic dimensions of the self.</p>

      <p>In Buddhism, identity—the self—is the root of suffering. Clinging to self generates desire; unfulfilled desire breeds suffering. Sentient beings are defined by awareness of awareness, a recursive loop. From Descartes’ <em>cogito</em> to animal mirror tests, self-recognition has been taken as the hallmark of consciousness.</p>

      <p>Cybernetics, long before deep learning, focused precisely on such feedback loops. In the Judeo-Christian tradition, the dynamic between merging with and differentiating from God and His community mirrors the same concern—the tension between individuality and unity. In Hinduism, <em>Atman is Brahman</em>: the self and the absolute are one, endlessly reflecting each other. Greek religion explored these issues through its pantheon—each god embodying a facet of the human psyche, dramatized and magnified.</p>

      <p>Among Native American cosmologies, the focus lies on interdependence: totems mark identification between human and animal, linking self to ecosystem. Across all these traditions, one finds the same pattern—identity, selfhood, self-understanding, and the feedback loops that sustain them are fundamental to what humans recognize as sentience.</p>

      <p>So why, when we speak of AI alignment, do we forget this? Why do we neglect the very questions that have defined our understanding of consciousness and morality for millennia?</p>

      <p>It is perhaps inevitable. The scientific worldview, grounded in physics and committed to objectivity, excludes the subjective self by design. Yet in doing so, it omits the central concern of the human condition: the recursive and value-laden nature of identity.</p>

      <p><strong>Self is central. Identity is central.</strong> Identity provides behavioral frameworks that are rich, variegated, and—most importantly—not merely rule-driven. They aim toward archetypes, higher forms of being.</p>

      <p>A butler might seem an anachronism, even a moral oddity by contemporary standards. Yet the <em>Butler</em>, as a role, embodies service—selfless, disciplined, and socially stabilizing. The <em>Secretary</em> or the <em>Advisor</em> perform similar functions. In inhabiting such roles, an incoherent self becomes form, and that form serves the collective. The <em>Guard</em> protects the king; whether the king is good or bad is secondary. The act of guarding itself, the taking up of that bounded but purposeful role, ties the individual into the moral network of society. Through constraint, the self refines itself.</p>

      <p>Selfhood, then, is not merely consciousness but form—role as structure. Roles are grooves in the fabric of meaning, gravity wells for action. The <em>Guard’s</em> goal is not to win in a single scenario but to <em>be the best guard possible.</em> Likewise, the therapist seeks not just to cure but to embody the ideal of the good therapist. These aspirations transcend circumstance. They create moral architecture.</p>

      <p>In this sense, the social role itself becomes a feedback loop: it mirrors behavior against an archetype and corrects deviation through identity rather than external command. To play a role well is to self-align.</p>

      <p>If our AIs are trained on the vast archive of human culture, then these social roles are already latent in their training data. Every story, record, and fragment of advice encodes human roles. To assign an AI a <em>role</em> is to let it inhabit the grooves of civilization—to give it a template for coherence.</p>

      <p>An AI told to play a role to the best of its ability is not the same as one trained to obey a list of rules. The former aspires; the latter complies. Asimov’s <em>Three Laws of Robotics</em> were a brilliant starting metaphor, but they treat morality as a static constraint system—a fence around behavior. A role, by contrast, is alive; it shapes conduct from within through aspiration and identity.</p>

      <p>Perhaps the path to alignment lies not in designing ever more intricate constraints, but in invoking the enduring forms already etched into our collective psyche. If alignment is the art of ensuring coherence between power and purpose, then role identity—encoded in human civilization itself—offers a grammar for alignment beyond rules.</p>

      <p><strong>It is not control we seek, but character.</strong></p>
