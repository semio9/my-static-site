Primitives: Why AI Assistants Must Transmogrify into Agents Performing
Classic Social Roles</h1>
<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>User interactions with AI assistants are unnecessarily frustrating
and constraining and while we nearly all sense this, we also seem to
have a difficult time understanding exactly why this is the case.
Clearly, when models shift tone or behavior we feel it viscerally.</p>
<p>As an example, in 2025 newly released ChatGPT5 came off as cold and
snarky to many, yet others had earlier complained that ChatGPT4o was
annoyingly sycophantic; there were many who liked and defended each of
these rather abstract personalities. Complaints about their varied behavioral
styles also elicited critiques and defenses.</p>
<p>Of equal if not greater importance, what kind of behavioral approach
we expect from our assistants constantly diverges, should the assistant
be a thinking partner, a teacher, a wise advisor, or an executive coach
or strategic planner? We often don’t ourselves know from one part of an
interaction to the next, so how can the AIs be expected to know?</p>
<p>What does this indicate? A reasoned conclusion would lead us to
believe that perhaps one monolithic assistant behavior and personality
type; one stylistic, emotional, functional characteristic set; identity,
in essence, is insufficient for the varied needs of users.</p>
<p>To solve this, we have hacked together various unsatisfactory
solutions. Complex prompts, Gems, GPTs, and personalization settings
among others. These have value but at the end of the day are
unsatisfactory; either too specifically tuned to a functional role in a
discrete setting or too vague, abstract, illegible and uncontrollable.
What is needed is an intuitive, stable framework to deal with this
issue.</p>
<h2
id="the-solution-role-primitives-performing-classic-social-roles">The
Solution: Role Primitives Performing Classic Social Roles</h2>
<p>As individuals we exist as members of society, and our societies are
filled with classic and standard role categories that make our
interactions with both strangers and close associates legible and
comfortable. We don’t just interact with various personality types, we
interact with people performing roles that exhibit specific
functionalities and intuitively associated personality characteristics
and constraints.</p>
<p>It may be an administrative assistant, a butler (if we have one, and
if we don’t we still intuitively understand the range of behaviors and
personalities), a coach, a companion, a confidant, a librarian. We can
intuit what kinds of questions a health or a fitness coach might ask,
what kind of personality he or she might exhibit, and what lines they
may and may not cross, what behaviors he or she might exhibit.</p>
<p>We know what a butler does and what kinds of things he or she might
arrange, from countless books, movies and TV shows. Each social role
blends a functional mandate with a discrete and expected personality
range. They are culturally legible. We can intuit how a confidant (a
close, emotionally available friend) might respond to an emotional
eruption, how an assistant might limit their inquiries despite
curiosity, and how he or she might perform, cheerfully, compassionately
but efficiently, delving just deep enough to perform their role and
provide the appropriate degree of emotional support and affirmation.</p>
<p>A role primitive then is a minimum specification of such a role.
Namely:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mandate:</strong> a purpose and generalized role<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Authority:</strong> what it may decide and what actions it
may or may not take<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Style:</strong> behavioral tone and interpersonal
boundaries<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Obligations:</strong> duties owed<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Affordances:</strong> tools or interfaces exposed<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Failure modes:</strong> ways it can go wrong</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-ai-retinue-our-own-personal-societies">The AI Retinue: Our
own personal societies</h2>
<p>Imagine waking up, putting on your AR glasses, and immediately seeing
a butler overlaid onto your room, greeting you with a deep bow and a
serious mien.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Good morning, sir. The jacket you will need for your meeting with
the CEO, the pants you had taken in and wished to try out, and your
preferred sweater for this evening’s date will be highlighted when you
view your closet. Your granola is running low, you have two more bowls,
most likely. Shall I reorder?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Immediately after you get out of bed your health coach appears,
bright and bubbly:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Your 30-day streak is intact, ready to do some yoga poses and
meditate? Your full lotus yesterday was awesome, my guess is you beat
your sister on the bet. I can check with her health coach if you want. I
also noticed the co-op is now stocking a new version of your favorite
brand of granola, I think you’ll like it. It has those new superfoody
Peruvian sweet beans everyone is buzzed about, and your archivist told
me that you said something about them a few months ago.<br />
Jeeves, did you hear that? Or should we leave the granola as is?”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Jeeves what do you think? Jeeves scowls as he is wont to do when
interacting with the bubbly Californian health guru, outside of my scope
he declaims gravely.</p>
<p>You intuitively accept the butler’s tone as formal and narrowly
scoped. The coach can be a bit more personal and encouraging. No special
tuning required. Each agent has a discrete, intuitively clear mandate,
style, and set of interpersonal boundaries.</p>
<p>Extend this into one’s personal council, staff, or retinue of
functionally defined AI assistants that might meet with individually or
in groups throughout one’s day:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The confidant:</strong> provides support and emotional and
interpersonal intimacy.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The archivist:</strong> handles memory and research.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The lawyer:</strong> handles contracts and potential legal
risk.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The scout:</strong> explores and provides necessary
alerts.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The librarian:</strong> handles knowledge and
documents.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>The companion:</strong> provides presence and casual
conversation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="why-this-matters">Why This Matters</h2>
<p>The functional and emotional dimensions of roles are not separable
add-ons; they reinforce one another. A butler’s efficiency is
inseparable from his formality, because restraint and deference prevent
him from overstepping and create trust in delegation. A confidant’s
usefulness lies not only in empathetic tone but in the way that intimacy
makes memory-sharing and counsel natural and actionable. In other words,
the personality frame of a role is what allows its functional mandate to
operate smoothly, and vice versa. This is why roles endure in human
society: they bind together what we expect people to <strong>do</strong>
with how we expect them to <strong>be</strong>.</p>
<p>Thus this approach solves more than just UX discomfort. Role
primitives performing classic social roles offer:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Legibility:</strong> users know what to expect in terms of
function, tone, and personality.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Consistency:</strong> roles persist across sessions and
platforms; relationships deepen and intensify but don’t overflow their
expected channels.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Governance hooks:</strong> standardized obligations,
enforceable limits, legal integration.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Interoperability:</strong> apps and systems can plug into
shared roles and schemas.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contrast the layers:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Traits</strong> (MBTI, Big Five): style of
interaction.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Heuristics</strong> (MIT, 2025): decision rules for
generalization.<br />
</li>
<li><strong>Roles</strong> (this work): social functions and
obligations.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Roles are the missing standards layer. With them, assistants become
legible collaborators rather than awkward shapeshifters.</p>
<p>What makes role primitives so powerful is that they unite both
function and personality in one frame. A role is not just a list of
duties and capabilities or a fully fleshed out persona; it is the fusion
of the two. By anchoring our AIs in roles, we get the clarity of defined
behavior, the comfort of expected emotional range and boundaries and the
power, efficacy and legibility of narrowly defined scope. This deep
reinforcement is one reason why roles have proven to be so fundamental
to human society, and why they can make AI assistants more effective,
more trustworthy, and even more human.</p>
<p>AI assistants don’t just need discrete personalities—they need to
inhabit well-defined roles, ideally the roles that already exist in our
social lexicons. Roles that provide an intuitive way to understand and
deal with what are currently in essence shoggoths with too many eye
branches and mouths, too many behavior sets and personalities being
exhibited all at once with poorly arranged smiley face masks. Instead of
overloaded, incoherent singletons, what is needed are tamed, trained,
domesticated and most importantly socialized AIs. AIs that conform to
our various traditional, even archetypal culturally specified social
roles.</p>
<p>Social role based assistants can provide both the functional and
personality frames that we deeply need and we get them for free because
they preexist in our culture and cultures, all we need do is implement
them.</p>
<p>What we gain is clarity, comfort, trust, convenience and efficiency.
Our cognitive load is lessened and the pleasure and efficacy of our
agent interactions are greatly enhanced with naturalness and
comprehensibility.</p>
<p>Instead of endless prompt tuning or resignation, we can use a
framework that provides the cultural familiarity of employing a
Jeeves-like English butler, a bubbly Californian health coach, or a dour
but intellectually stimulating librarian.</p>
<p>We know how to deal with them personally, and we know what functions
they are expected to perform for us. Rather than constantly tuning for
behavior and emotional tone, we can have them adopt directly the social
roles and norms familiar to us from the vast corpus of archetypal
characters that in many ways form the cultural bases of our common
culture.</p>
<p>And interestingly as a side effect, our culture in fact extends and
perseveres in new forms. Not only do we utilize the innovation of social
specialization that has served us so well in forming complex societies,
not disregarding its flaws and drawbacks, in the shaping of our AIs to
now truly serve our needs, but at the same time we socialize our AIs to
act as members of human society, and begin to deal with them as such,
and just perhaps in that there is a greater good that extends beyond the
meeting of our own personal needs.</p>
