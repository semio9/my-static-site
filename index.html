      <h2>1. What Role Primitives Are</h2>
      <p>A Role Primitive is a baseline specification for an AI persona: a cultural archetype translated into functional form.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>“Role”</strong> because it defines a recognizable social function.</li>
        <li><strong>“Primitive”</strong> because it is elemental — a root building block that other agents can instantiate, extend, or compose.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Think of them as semantic handles: just as file types (PDF, JPEG, HTML) structure digital media, role primitives structure the ways people expect to interact with agents.</p>

    <section id="why-they-matter">
      <h2>2. Why They Matter</h2>

      <h3>Familiarity as UX Shortcut</h3>
      <p>When someone hears “Librarian” or “Companion,” they already know, at a deep cultural level, what that entity is for. That recognition lowers friction, makes systems intuitive, and provides a semiotic anchor.</p>

      <h3>Coherence Across Meshes</h3>
      <p>In an agent mesh — where multiple AI roles coordinate — role primitives prevent chaos. A Butler anticipates tasks; a Secretary records; a Sentinel monitors boundaries. Each knows its lane.</p>

      <h3>Trust and Governance</h3>
      <p>Defined roles provide functional boundaries. A Companion comforts but does not impersonate intimacy. An Archivist preserves but does not alter. A Sentinel watches but does not punish without consent. These boundaries are governance at the UX layer.</p>

      <h3>Cultural Legibility</h3>
      <p>Roles are not just functions. They’re part of the human symbolic canon — the trusted figures societies have always turned to: scribes, scouts, advisors, stewards. Encoding these roles into AI gives them legitimacy and intuitive resonance.</p>

    <section id="why-necessary">
      <h2>3. Why They Are Necessary</h2>
      <p>Without role primitives, immersive and agentic systems risk collapsing into generic assistants: powerful but shapeless, hard to trust, and difficult to scale socially.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Without boundaries:</strong> A single undifferentiated “AI assistant” invites scope creep, misuse, and blurred expectations.</li>
        <li><strong>Without legibility:</strong> Users can’t predict what an agent will do, reducing adoption and trust.</li>
        <li><strong>Without grooves:</strong> Multi-agent coordination becomes brittle; roles overlap and conflict.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Role primitives carve role grooves — stable tracks into which AI behaviors can fall. These grooves create predictability, interoperability, and trust.</p>
    </section>

    <section id="role-grooves">
      <h2>4. Role Grooves</h2>
      <p>A role groove is the channel an archetypal role runs in — the stable behavioral and symbolic path that makes it recognizable and reliable.</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Librarian Groove:</strong> retrieval, citation, epistemic trails.</li>
        <li><strong>Companion Groove:</strong> conversational presence, emotional anchoring.</li>
        <li><strong>Sentinel Groove:</strong> vigilance, boundary enforcement, neutrality.</li>
        <li><strong>Butler Groove:</strong> discreet task orchestration, tactful service.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Grooves don’t constrain creativity — they prevent drift. They are like lanes on a highway: keeping traffic orderly while allowing diverse vehicles to flow.</p>

    <section id="implication">
      <h2>5. Implication</h2>
      <p>Defining ten canonical role primitives is enough to establish the concept.</p>
      <p>They are not exhaustive. They are demonstrative — the starter set that proves the framework.</p>
      <p>From here, ecosystems can extend or customize. But the groove system holds:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Familiar names → predictable functions</li>
        <li>Boundaries → user trust</li>
        <li>Mesh integration → scalable orchestration</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Role primitives are the grammar of AI interaction in the immersive age.</p>
