**Role Primitives and the Architecture of AI Social Roles**  
**CC0 1.0 · First published July 2025**

“This repository supersedes the archived symbollayer/symbollayer repository and is the currently maintained canonical source.”

---

## Overview

Symbol Layer is an open framework for defining archetypal AI social roles.  
It contains specifications, essays and supporting site files that translate classic human roles such as Librarian, Butler, Archivist, Companion, Confidant, Secretary and Therapist into reusable patterns for AI agents.

The project treats social roles as a kind of symbolic operating system for agents. Each role primitive is both a conceptual lens and a practical design surface for behavior, interaction and alignment.
